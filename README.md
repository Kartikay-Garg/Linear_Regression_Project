## Linear Regression Project
### In this repository, I have uploaded some projects that are related to the linear regression algorithm of machine learning.

1) House Price Estimator
~~~
Your neighbor is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting housing prices for regions in the USA. It would be great if you could somehow create a model for her that allows her to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.

She has asked you if you could help her out with your new data science skills. You say yes, and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem!

Your neighbor then gives you some information about a bunch of houses in regions of the United States,it is all in the data set: USA_Housing.csv.

The data contains the following columns:

* 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
* 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city
* 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
* 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
* 'Area Population': Population of city house is located in
* 'Price': Price that the house sold at
* 'Address': Address for the house

2) Ecommerce Website User Experience Estimator
~~~
Congratulations! You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!

Just follow the steps below to analyze the customer data (it's fake, don't worry I didn't give you real credit card numbers or emails).

We'll work with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company. It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

* Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
* Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
* Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
